# First Order Logic - Sympy library extension

Introduction of classes (variables, quantifiers, predicates and clauses) and methods for FOL by extending the Propositional Logic semantics and methods that are built-in in the Sympy library. In particular, the project concerns the implementation of a method for getting the grounding of a FOL formula, a method for finding the most general unifier between two terms and a method for applying the Binary Resolution Rule on two clauses.
The whole implementation is contained in the Python notebook. It also includes a user-friendly interface (that uses LaTeX) for the visualization of the formulas.
