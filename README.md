# First Order Logic - Sympy library extension

Introduction of classes (variables, quantifiers, predicates and clauses) and methods for FOL by extending the Propositional Logic semantics and methods that are built-in in the Sympy library. In particular, the project concerns the implementation of a method for getting the grounding of a FOL formula, a method for finding the most general unifier between two terms and a method for applying the Binary Resolution Rule on two clauses.
The whole implementation is contained in the Python notebook. It also includes a user-friendly interface (that uses LaTeX) for the visualization of the formulas. 

This work is an extention of [Filip Šamánek - "Implementation of FOL algorithms for the SymPy library" (2019)](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/83057?show=full).

In the Sympy library we can already find a module for Propositional Logic. The aim of the project is to expand the library to support FOL: see the diagram below.
